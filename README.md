- **Summary:**  
  This systematic literature review examines the role of deep learning-based computer vision (DL-based CV) for autonomous UAV navigation. The study categorizes research into four key domains:  
  - 🔍 Sensing and inspection  
  - 🛬 Landing  
  - 🎥 Surveillance and tracking  
  - 🚁 Search and rescue  
  The paper highlights trends, challenges, and emerging technologies such as in-sensor computing and the YOLO framework's growing prominence in UAV applications.
- **Key Insights:**  
  - 🚀 Over 39.5% of studies utilize the YOLO framework for UAV applications.  
  - 🔍 Deep learning enhances UAV autonomy by improving real-time perception.  
  - 📌 Challenges include data availability, energy consumption, and computational constraints.
